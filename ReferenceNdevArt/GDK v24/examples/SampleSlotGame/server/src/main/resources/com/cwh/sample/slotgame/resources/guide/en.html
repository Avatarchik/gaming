        <h1>ULTIMATE TEXAS HOLD'EM</h1>
        </div>
<div id="objective">

        <p>Ultimate Texas Hold'em  is a community card poker game. The object is to make a better five-card poker hand than the dealer, using your two-card hand and five community cards. There is also an optional Trips bet, where you win if your final five-card hand is Three of a Kind or higher.</p>
</div>
<div id="playing"> 
        <p><strong>Regular Play</strong></p>
        <p>The game uses a standard 52-card deck, shuffled after every round. </p>
  <p>Click on the chip stack located in the bottom right 
              corner of the screen to select the desired bet amount.  
For convenience, the value of the last chip clicked on the chip stack 
          is held in memory and can be repeated without 
  returning to the chip stack. The chip stack only appears when it's possible to change denominations.</p>
  <p>Higher credit denominations: 1K=1000, 1M=1 000 000, 1B=1 000 000 000.</p>
  <p>You must make equal bets on both the Ante and Blind. When you place a bet on the Ante bet area, an  identical bet is placed on the Blind bet area, and vice versa. You can also place an optional Trips bet by clicking in the <strong>Trips </strong>bet area. The Trips bet can be for a different amount than the Ante/Blind bets. </p>
  <p>Click the left panel or the table card to show the table limits and payouts. </p>
  <p>To remove a bet, hold down the Shift key and click on a chip to remove it from the table. The <strong>Undo</strong> button will undo your last action, whether it was adding or removing a chip. </p>
  <p>Click <strong>Deal</strong>. After the first hand, you can use the <b>Same Bet</b> button to repeat 
    your last bet(s) and start the deal.</p>
  <p>The cards are dealt and your hole cards are turned face up. </p>
  <p>At this point, you can bet or check. You  can make a Play bet of either 3 or 4 times your Ante bet, e.g., if you bet 5.00  on the Ante and selected <strong>3x</strong>, the Play bet would be 15.00.   All the cards are then turned over and a winner determined with no  additional betting rounds. </p>
<p>If you   select <strong>Check </strong>instead, you can continue without increasing your bet. The first 3 community cards (known as the flop) are turned over. You can then check again to see the rest of the community cards without increasing your bet, or you can increase your bet by 2 times your Ante bet.  If you make the 2x bet, the final two community cards will be turned over and a winner determined without an additional round of betting. </p>
  <p>If you checked again, the final two community cards are turned over and then you can either select <strong>Fold</strong> and lose your Ante and Blind bets, or you can make a bet equal to the Ante bet. The dealer's cards will be turned over and a winner determined. </p>
<p>Play bets do not apply to the Trips bet, which is never increased after the intial bet. </p>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<p>The system determines whether you or the dealer has the best five-card poker hand, using any combination of hole cards and community cards. The cards in the winning five-card hand will be raised slightly from the table. </p>
<p>The individual Ante, Blind, Play and Trips bets all have different conditions under which they pay out:</p>
<p><strong>Dealer Qualifying</strong></p>
<p>The dealer needs at least a pair to qualify. However, unlike some other casino games, you don't automatically win if the dealer does not qualify.  </p>
<p><strong>Ante Bet</strong></p>
<p>If the dealer qualifies and you have the higher hand then the Ante will pay even money (1:1). If the dealer qualifies and the dealer has the higher hand then your Ante bet will lose. If it's a tie or the dealer does not qualify then the Ante bet will push (your bet is returned to you). </p>
<p><strong>Blind Bet</strong></p>
<p>If your hand wins with a straight or better, the Blind bet will pay according to the pay table. If you have a better hand than the dealer, but less than a straight, the Blind bet pushes. If the dealer has the higher hand, your Blind bet loses, even if the dealer did not qualify.</p>
<p><strong>Play Bet</strong></p>
<p>If you have the higher hand the Play bet will pay even money. If the dealer has the higher hand the Play bet will lose, regardless of whether or not the dealer has qualified.</p>
<p><strong>Ties</strong></p>
<p>If you and dealer tie, then the Ante, Blind, and Play bets will all push.</p>
</div>
<div id="bonus">
  <p><strong>Trips Bet Results</strong></p>
  <p>You win  if your final 5-card hand is Trips (3 of a Kind) or higher. Winning Trips bets are paid out regardless of whether the main hand wins, loses or pushes. You can win a Trips bet even  if you fold.</p>
  <p>For the exact payouts, see the Table Limits and Payouts panel. </p>
